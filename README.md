NUMBER OF THE LETTERS IN THE LYRIC ! 

This work is about calculation of frequency of the unique letters in a lyric 
using basic python commands. It would be a first step for future project which
analyses the rock'n'roll lyric letters (mainly 80's) by creating database.

I have written this function to improve myself,give useful ideas to python users and get fun.

for much more information how to use this function, visit my Medium page

I would want to dedicate this my first public function to "Ronnie James DIO" and "Rainbow"...
which are the one the best rock vocals and music band in the universe.

I am opening to suggestions and corrections
Thanks
